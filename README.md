NCAA Football Draft Class Editor for PS2-era games

This lets you open and view, and edit players, attributes, gear, etc.

Find your NCAA Football Draft Class save file:

It must be the raw file (e.g. from PCSX2 Memory Card Folders, an export of the file from PS2 Memory Card save files using MyMC, or extracted from PS2 Save Builder).
The file name should start with BASLUS-xxxxx.
